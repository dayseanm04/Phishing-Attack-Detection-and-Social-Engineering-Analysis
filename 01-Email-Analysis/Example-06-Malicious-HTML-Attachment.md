## Security Analysis  

### 1. Poor Grammar and Unprofessional Language  
The email body contains multiple grammatical errors:

- “I just send the money” instead of “I just sent the money”  
- “as ask” instead of “as asked”  
- “western union” not capitalized  

Legitimate financial communications are professionally written and grammatically correct.

### 2. Identity Mismatch

- The sender email is **tbaust@lps.org** (Theresa Baustert)  
- The message is signed **Uzman Shamsi**  

This inconsistency between sender identity and signature is a major red flag and suggests account compromise or spoofing.
