## Security Analysis  

### 1. Sender Address Mismatch
- The email claims to be from a USA lottery organization  
- The actual sender domain is **kysmaq.co.jp**  
- The **.jp** domain indicates Japan
- kysmaq is a medical store in Japan (I searched it up on Google, See Bellow)

A legitimate U.S. lottery organization would not use an Japanese domain. This is a major **red flag**.

### 2. Generic Greeting

- The message does not include the recipient’s name  
- It uses a generic statements  

Legitimate prize notifications would have included verified recipient details.

---

### 3. Grammar and Spelling Errors  
The email contains multiple errors:
- Missing spacing and punctuation
- Bad grammer, the emails says "Congratulations you have won the usa mega millions email lottery.attachements below is your winner..." instead of something like "Congratulations you have won the usa mega millions lottery. Attached below is your winner prize information, view the procedures on how to claim your prize"
