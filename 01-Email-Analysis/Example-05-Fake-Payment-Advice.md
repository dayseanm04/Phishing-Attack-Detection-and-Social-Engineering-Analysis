## Security Analysis  

### 1. Suspicious Sender Address  
- The sender email is **mail_server@company.com**  
- The domain is generic and does not represent a known financial institution  
- Legitimate banks and financial institutions use official domain names  

Notification emails from legitimate organizations typically come from structured addresses like: no-reply@bankname.com  

The use of a vague “company.com” domain is a major red flag.

### 2. Unsolicited Financial Attachment  
- The email includes an attachment titled **Payment Advice.pdf**  
- The recipient was probably not expecting a payment notification  
- Unsolicited financial documents are commonly used to distribute malware  

Banks typically provide statements through secure portals rather than random email attachments.
